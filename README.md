# simple_windows_installer
This is a starting point for developing a basic windows installer: a 7zip self-extracting executable that extracts a folder to a temp folder, and runs install.bat in an elevated shell.  This utility is based on 7zip and Nirsoft's nircmd to run the batch file in an elevated shell.
